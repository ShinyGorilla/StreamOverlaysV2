# StreamOverlaysV2
A modification for Gorilla Tag. Adds a text showing the room code you are in and how many players are in that room (located at the top left.) I believe this mod already existed and it may have broke called Stream Overlays. This is just a bit different and made by me

## Changelog
1. Made compatible with the Computer Interface mod tab. Also works with Computer++ (https://github.com/KyleTheScientist/ComputerPlusPlus)

2. Removed italic font

3. Cleaned up some code
